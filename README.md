# Algorithm for multiples of 2, 3, 5 in C++

  Consider a series of ascending order that only consists of numbers
  that can be factored by any combination of 2, 3, and 5. e.g. 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,15

    Example:
    1. 1 
    2. 2
    3. 3
    4. 4 = 2*2
    5. 5
    6. 6 = 2 * 3
    7. 8 = 2 * 2 * 2
    8. 9 = 3 * 3
    9. 10 = 2 * 5
